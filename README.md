OpenCV Basics

This repository contains my practice and experiments with OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library. Currently, the project is focused on understanding the fundamentals of image and video processing before moving into advanced topics.

📌 Current Progress

Reading and displaying images using OpenCV

Reading and displaying videos from file and webcam

Exploring basic operations (resizing, grayscale conversion, flipping, etc.)

Understanding how frames are captured and processed

🎯 Learning Goals

Build a strong foundation in OpenCV basics

Progress from simple image/video reading to image transformations, drawing, and filters

Prepare for advanced projects like object detection, face recognition, and real-time computer vision applications

⚙️ Features (so far)

Image reading (cv2.imread) and display (cv2.imshow)

Video capture using webcam and video files (cv2.VideoCapture)

Keyboard event handling (cv2.waitKey) for video frame navigation

Basic preprocessing techniques (resize, color conversion, flip)

🛠️ Libraries Used

OpenCV (cv2) – Computer vision library

NumPy – Array operations for image data
